<h3> <u>Tagline </u>: Predicting Urban Heat Islands using AI and Satellite Data </h3>

<H3><b>Problem Statement</b></H3>
<p>"Indian cities are experiencing rising temperatures due to increased urbanization. This project aims to predict whether an area will become a UHI in the future based on weather, air quality, and urbanization data, Help city planners make informed decisions about urban heat risks."</p>

<h3><b>Objective & Goals</b></h3>
<p>The project aims to leverage AI-driven climate analytics to predict Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) and provide insights for sustainable urban planning. By analyzing historical weather patterns, air quality indices, and urbanization factors, the model forecasts which areas are at high risk of extreme heat events in the future.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Predict UHIs using Machine Learning models.</li>
  <li>Provide real-time predictions for users based on input location data.</li>
  <li>Help city planners make informed decisions about urban heat risks.</li>
</ul>

<h3> <b> Key Features in the Model</b></h3>
<ol>
  <li>Predict Future Urban Heat Islands (UHIs)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Build an ML-powered system that predicts whether an area will turn into an Urban Heat Island.</li>

  </ul>
  <li>Data-Driven Urban Planning & Policy Recommendations</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Offer actionable insights for city planners and environmental organizations.</li>
    <li>Help reduce the urban heat effect by suggesting green cover, water bodies, and ventilation corridors.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Innovation with Scalable & Deployable ML Models</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop a highly accurate machine learning model using Random Forest & XGBoost.</li>
    <li> Plan for future deployment as a web or mobile application for wider accessibility.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>

<h2> Why This Matter ?</h2>
<p>This project goes beyond just predictionsâ€”it provides real-time, data-driven recommendations that can shape climate resilience strategies. By making this information accessible, we contribute to a sustainable, heat-resilient future for urban India! </p>
